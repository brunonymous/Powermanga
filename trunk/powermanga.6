.SH NAME
powermanga \- shoot\-'em\-up game
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B powermanga "[OPTIONS]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Powermanga is a shoot'em up game; you will have to fight more than 60 different types of enemies.
.P
You start with a ship, and enemies show up throwing bombs at you. Shoot them, and get better weapons for your ship (otherwise, you won't go too far!)
.P
To get better weapons, you will have to catch green and red gems. Whenever you pick a green gem, the highlighted option at the right side of the screen goes up one unit.
.P
The options are, from the bottom to the top:
.TP
- More speed
.TP
- More energy to your ship
If you get out of energy, you lose your ship. Losing your ship means either going back to the ship you were using before you "upgraded' it, or dying if you had no previous ship! You can check your energy level in the little bar at the bottom (the bar at the right is yours; the one at the left is your enemy's, in case you're fighting a big one)
.TP
- Several options for different weapons
.TP
- The last option gets you a better ship
.P
If the current option is "more power to the leftside straight weapons", for example, you may select it and they will immediately take effect.
.P
If the current option is already the last, and you pick a green or red gem, you will go back to the first one (but you will get an extra side-weapon). Also, whenever you pick an option, the current option goes back to the first one.
.SH THE GEMS
During the game, you will sometimes see gems falling down when an enemy is destroyed. You may catch those gems:
.TP
- Green gems
As we said before, makes the current option go up one unit.
.TP
- Red gems
Similar to the green gem, but it increases 2 units instead of 1.
.TP
- Pink gems
Gives energy to your ship. If your energy is at the maximum level, this gem will give you a full blast that destroys all enemies currently on the screen.
.TP
- Blue gems
They multiply the score points for each destroyed enemy by 2. If you get the blue gem again, the score points are multiplied by 4; you can see the "2x" or "4x" blinking at the sidebar.
.TP
- Yellow gems
These give you protection balls. If you already have six protection balls and you get another yellow gem, you will get a special weapon!
.SH CHANGING SHIPS
When you get a better ship, you will be able to accumulate more energy, becoming more resistant to attacks. But whenever you "upgrade" your ship, a few things will happen:
.TP
- Protection
You will lose all your protection balls (let's say they're not "compatible" with your new ship).
.TP
- Weapons
You will lose one "degree" in your weapons (if you had used green gems to get the best possible weapon for shooting straight forward, for example, after upgrading your ship you will have to get one more green gem if you want your weapons at the maximum power.)
.TP
- Score
If your score was getting multiplied by 2 or 4, it won't be anymore (go get more blue gems!)
